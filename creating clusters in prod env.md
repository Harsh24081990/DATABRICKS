In production, once an **ADF pipeline** triggers a Databricks notebook activity, the cluster configuration comes from **the ADF activity settings itself**, not from a pre-created cluster in Databricks Compute pane.

---

### **How it works**

* In the **ADF "Databricks Notebook" activity**:

  * You select **Cluster Type** → *New job cluster* (prod standard).
  * You define:

    * Node type (e.g., `Standard_E32ds_v5`)
    * Min/max workers (for autoscaling)
    * Spark version
    * Any Spark config overrides
  * These settings are stored **inside the ADF pipeline JSON definition**.
* When ADF triggers:

  1. ADF calls Databricks REST API.
  2. Databricks **reads the cluster config passed in that API call** (from ADF JSON).
  3. Databricks spins up a **job cluster** with those specs.
  4. Job runs, cluster auto-terminates.

### Note : 
When the pipeline runs, ADF doesn’t pick an existing cluster from the databricks Compute pane — it passes the ADF notebook activity JSON to Databricks API, which spins up a fresh cluster with these specs.

Here’s an example of an **ADF pipeline JSON snippet** for a Databricks notebook activity using a **new job cluster** in production:

```json

    "name": "DatabricksNotebookActivity",

        "retryIntervalInSeconds": 30,
        "secureOutput": false,
        "secureInput": false
    },
    "typeProperties": {
        "notebookPath": "/ProdJobs/DataProcessing",
        "baseParameters": {
            "inputPath": "abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/input",
            "outputPath": "abfss://container@storageaccount.dfs.core.windows.net/output"
        },
        "newCluster": {

            },

            },
            "customTags": {
                "Project": "ETL-Prod",

            },
            "spark_env_vars": {

            },
            "init_scripts": [],
            "enableElasticDisk": true
        }
    },
    "linkedServiceName": {
        "referenceName": "AzureDatabricksLinkedService",
        "type": "LinkedServiceReference"
    }
}
```

**Where the cluster config lives:**

* Everything inside `"newCluster": { ... }` is **the full cluster definition** that ADF sends to Databricks.
* When the pipeline runs, **ADF doesn’t pick an existing cluster from the Compute pane** — it passes this JSON to Databricks API, which spins up a fresh cluster with these specs.

---

In real production projects, you almost never have **only one cluster** for all pipelines.
Instead, cluster usage depends on **project size, job type, and cost strategy**:

---

### **Common production patterns**

1. **One cluster per pipeline run** (most common for batch ETL)

   * Each ADF pipeline triggers a **job cluster** (new cluster) with specs defined in that pipeline.
   * After the job completes, the cluster **auto-terminates**.
   * Pros: Clean, isolated environment; avoids job interference.
   * Cons: More startup time (\~2–5 mins per run).

2. **Multiple pipelines sharing a pool**

   * Databricks **cluster pools** keep nodes warm.
   * Job clusters for different pipelines are created **from the same pool**, reducing startup cost/time.
   * Still one job cluster per pipeline run, but sharing pool resources.

3. **Shared interactive cluster for multiple jobs** (rare in prod, more in dev/test)

   * A single always-running cluster executes many jobs/pipelines.
   * Used for low-latency streaming jobs or small-scale batch processes.
   * Cons: Resource contention, risk of job conflicts.

4. **Different cluster configs for different workloads**

   * **Heavy ETL jobs** → large, memory-optimized nodes (e.g., `E32ds_v5`).
   * **ML jobs** → GPU clusters.
   * **Small data prep jobs** → smaller, cheaper nodes.
