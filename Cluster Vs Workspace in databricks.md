Clusters are about compute resources and running tasks, while Workspaces are about organization, collaboration, and management of projects and notebooks.

A cluster is tied to a single workspace in Databricks and cannot be shared across multiple workspaces. However, you can share data and code across workspaces using unity catalog, but each workspace must manage its own clusters separately.


**Databricks cluster can only belong to one workspace**.

### üîç **Why?**

- A **cluster** in Databricks is a set of compute resources (like VMs) **scoped to a specific workspace**.
- Workspaces are **logically isolated environments** that come with their own:
  - Users & permissions
  - Notebooks & repos
  - Jobs & clusters
  - Databricks runtime settings

Because of that separation:
- **Clusters cannot be shared** across multiple workspaces.
- Each workspace must **create, configure, and manage its own clusters.**

### ‚úÖ **However‚Ä¶ You *can* share data/code across workspaces using:**

#### 1. **Unity Catalog**
- Enables **centralized governance** of data assets across multiple workspaces.
- Allows different workspaces to **access the same tables** in a common metastore.

#### 2. **Repos / Git Integration**
- You can share **code across workspaces** using Git-based workflows.
- Notebooks and workflows can be synced to/from a Git repo used across environments.
